approximate sine/cos with neural net

analyse sentiment timeline in speaches / books / movies
	break into sentences 
	compute sentiment
	look for pattern
	
Recreate homer picture
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVuU2YCwHjw
	How (idea)
		Find pixel edges/points
		Convert to graph
		Find euler/hamilton path through graph to build parametric x/y signal
		Fourier transform this x/y
		
Generate all possible pictures
	500x500 pixel grid that updates as a function of time
	estimate how long to famous pictures
	
Crossword solver 
	use word2vec	
	or constraints
	
Make a functioning haskell program without prelude
	https://wiki.haskell.org/No_import_of_Prelude
	
API given email address returns info on that person
	finds facebook/linkedin profile

Use echonest api to blend songs
	Like infinite jukebox but for more than 1 song
	http://labs.echonest.com/Uploader/faq.html

does resampling (with replacement) training data between epochs improve generalisation

age a face using neural nets
	use same method as google deep dreams
	
hill climbing algorithms do actual hill climbing

determine most likely location of reddit user based on time of posts.
	Could get ground truth by analysing city subreddits in known time zones.

train a NN to send signals via sound
	basically need to trainan autoencoder that transmits sound in the middle
	
Find hidden airports
	Track planes like the one in HAI video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWNGAUvSyOc) 
	from historic data https://uk.flightaware.com/live/flight/N859WP.
	Planes about to land should be slowing down to dropping in altitude.
	How should disappear at regular locations
	
	Maybe using proportion of disappearing planes in area could be interesting
	
Colony of neural networks
	Can a colony of neural networks evolve together?
	Simulate an ant colony, success being solving group challenges like https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-simple-algorithm-that-ants-use-to-build-bridges-20180226/

	More confusing = something to hide

Play with cloud functions
	Show that they're actually stateful. Implement a counter and show that it increments between invocations
	Can you build a whole domain with routing?
