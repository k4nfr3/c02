On top of this, the inaugeration address corpus is relatively tiny and is certainly not large enough for any serious Deep Neural Net work. The corpus features just less than 10,000 unique words.\n",

We use another model that we train before the text generation model. This technique, of encoding words into lower dimension space while preserving similarities, is called word embedding.
